# UltraEdit-clone

This repository is a clone of UltraEdit, created purely for practice to sharpen my skills in HTML and CSS. The project replicates the basic structure and styling of the UltraEdit interface but does not include any functionality.

# Overview
The goal of this project is to focus on:

 - Structuring the webpage using HTML5.
 - Styling the interface using CSS3.
This is a static clone and <b> does not include any actual code editing or IDE functionality </b>. It is intended to practice layout design and styling only.
