# UltraEdit-clone

This repository is a clone of UltraEdit, created purely for practice to sharpen my skills in HTML and CSS. The project replicates the basic structure and styling of the UltraEdit interface but does not include any functionality.

# Overview
The goal of this project is to focus on:

 - Structuring the webpage using HTML5.
 - Styling the interface using CSS3.
This is a static clone and <b> does not include any actual code editing or IDE functionality</b>. It is intended to practice layout design and styling only.

# Features
 - Basic layout of the UltraEdit text editor.
 - Simple HTML5 structure to represent the different parts of the interface (menu bar, sidebar, editor window, status bar).
CSS3 styling to mimic the look and feel of the UltraEdit interface.

# Technologies Used

 - CSS3

# Future Improvements
 - Enhance the design with responsive styles for better mobile view.
 - Add interactivity using JavaScript for a more dynamic interface.
